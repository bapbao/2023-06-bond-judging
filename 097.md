# Reentrancy attack vulnerability in the deploy() function

## Summary

The `deploy() `function in the code snippet is susceptible to a reentrancy attack. The vulnerability arises from the deployment process of `FixedStrikeOptionToken` contract. Interactions with external contracts are involved, which introduces a potential _reentrancy vulnerability_ .

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `deploy()` function, a new `FixedStrikeOptionToken` contract is deployed if it does not already exist. But this deployment process involves interacting with external contracts, which introduces a potential _reentrancy vulnerability_.
If an attacker can call the `deploy() ` function from a malicious contract, they can potentially trigger _reentrant calls_ by recursively invoking the `deploy()` function before the previous deployment completes. 
This can lead to unexpected behaviors and allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the contract and exploit vulnerabilities.

## Impact
This **Reentrancy attack** can enable the attacker to manipulate the contract's state and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.

## Recommendation

Perform all state-changing operations before interacting with external contracts.
