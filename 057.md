# Not setting an init value of lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender] could lead to OOG

## Summary
When staking, there is no initial value set for lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender] which means it's 0.
When unstaking, a loop is used to go threw lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender] till current epoch.

Imagine we're at epoch 100, this will result in a OOG.

Note: this is different from my previous issue "Unstaking or claiming rewards could end up in OOG" as this as a different orgin.
## Vulnerability Detail

User will not be able to claim rewards since emerganceWithdrawal needs to be used. 
This might have more impact then OOG but due to limited time I was not able to check that out, sorry.

set lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender] to current epoch when staking
