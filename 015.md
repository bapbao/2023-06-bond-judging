# Deploy unlimited number of contracts.

## Summary
The deploy function allows any user to deploy an unlimited number of OTLM contracts. (OTLMFactory.sol)

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could spam the network with a high number of contracts, consuming a significant amount of gas and potentially causing disruption.

## Impact
It seems that there's no restriction or cost associated with deploying OTLM contracts, a malicious user could create a large number of contracts to spam the network, potentially disrupting the contract's intended usage and causing unnecessary overhead for users and the network as a whole.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a restriction or a fee mechanism to limit the number of contracts that can be created by a single user.
