# Lacks address-zero check

## Summary

Certain functions lack address-zero checks, which may result in lost funds and render the contract inoperable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is related to missing address-zero checks in the following areas:

1. `OTLM.setOptionReceiver()`: The function does not include a check to ensure that the `receiver_` address is not the zero address. 

2. `OTLMFactory.constructor()`: The constructor of the `OTLMFactory` contract does not verify whether the `optionTeller_` address provided is the zero address.

## Impact

The absence of address-zero checks can lead to the following consequences:

1. Inability to receive the quote tokens: If the `receiver_` address passed to `OTLM.setOptionReceiver()` is the zero address, the quote tokens will not be retrievable, resulting in potential loss of funds.

2. Inability to deploy OTLM contracts: If the `optionTeller_` address provided to `OTLMFactory.constructor()` is the zero address, the creation of OTLM contracts will be prevented.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement address-zero checks in the relevant functions

1. In the `OTLM.setOptionReceiver()` function, add an address-zero check:

```solidity
function setOptionReceiver(address receiver_) external override {
    require(receiver_ != address(0), "Invalid receiver address");
    // Existing function code...
}
```

2. In the `OTLMFactory.constructor()` constructor, add an address-zero check:

```solidity
constructor(
    address optionTeller_,
    uint256 initialOfferAmount_,
    uint256 expirationTime_
) {
    require(optionTeller_ != address(0), "Invalid option teller address");
    // Existing constructor code...
}
```
