# Option token created from OTLM is unable to be exercised

## Summary
Option token created from OTLM is unable to be exercised

## Vulnerability Detail
When epoch is started or epoch reward is claimed, OTLM will create option token (See OTLM.sol#L192 and OTLM.sol#505). 

During option token creation, option will be minted to msg.sender (See FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L296). The msg.sender here refers to the OTLM's contract address. 

Token that was created from OTLM is unable to be exercised because there is no function to exercise it in OTLM.sol. No EOA is allowed to execute the exercise function and burn the token because they are not the msg.sender. (See FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L383)

## Impact
It is meaningless to create Option token from OTLM as it is unable to be exercised.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Personally, I have a feeling that the developer believes that msg.sender would be set to the EOA who starts the epoch or claim the epoch reward. Therefore, I would suggest adding a parameter to FixedStrikeOptionTeller#create.

Change 
```create(FixedStrikeOptionToken optionToken_, uint256 amount_)```
 
to

```create(FixedStrikeOptionToken optionToken_, uint256 amount_,  address optionCreator)```

And during creation, mint the option token to the optionCreator and not to msg.sender
