# Missing check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down

## Summary
The smart contracts of Bond will be deployed on both the Mainnet and Arbitrum.
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it is necessary to verify the status of the sequencer to prevent "current" strike prices from appearing up-to-date when they are actually not.
## Vulnerability Detail
No systematic validation is in place to detect whether the L2 Arbitrum sequencer is operational or experiencing downtime.
## Impact
Unfair strike price could potentially be obtained

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have a mainnet version of the contract (as is) and L2 version of the contract which implements the sequencer feed check.
