# The period in which `optionTokens` are executable is up to nearly 1 day shorter than intended

## Summary

When calculating the expiration date of the `optionToken` it is “rounded to the nearest day at 0000 UTC”. This can lead to a up to nearly one day shorter execution time for the `optionToken` then intended. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Example:

eligibilityDuration = 7 days

New epoch is initated at 01.01.2024 at 11:59 pm

The expirations should be on the 08.01.2024 at 11:59 pm

Since the expiration is rounded down to 00:00 am it is actually 08.01.2024 at 00:00 making the claiming period nearly 1 day shorter than intended.    


## Impact

If a OTLM owner sets the `optionDuration` to 7 days they will also communicate this to their stakers. If the duration turns out to be shorter than expected stakers loose out on potential gains from the `optionTokens` since they miss the time they can execute them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Round up the expiration date to ensure that the intended `eligibleDuration` set by the owner of the OTLM is met
