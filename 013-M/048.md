# A malicious user can prevent reward accrual

## Summary

A malicious user cause the reward calculation in the `currentRewardsPerToken` function to round down due to repeatedly calling the `stake` function and causing too little time to pass between the calls.

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious user can repeatedly call `stake` with a small `amount_` (e.g., `1 wei`) to trigger the `updateRewards` modifier to calculate the current rewards per token. If the time between the calls is small enough, the calculation of `rewardsToApply` in lines 544-545 can possibly round down to zero, thus preventing the accrual of rewards.

Depending on the payout token's decimals, the `rewardRate` is potentially a lower value. And given that only a few seconds have passed, the division by `REWARD_PERIOD = uint48(1 days)` in line 544 will result in a value of 0.

For instance, on Optimism Bedrock, the [time between blocks is **2 seconds**](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#accessing-l1-information), allowing an attacker to execute this "attack" every 2 seconds at best. Given enough capital, an attacker is able to prevent the accrual of rewards for all other users for a prolonged period of time.

## Impact

Rewards are not accrued.

```solidity

540:     // Rewards do not accrue if the total balance is zero
541:     if (totalBalance == 0) return rewardsPerTokenStored;
542:
543:     // The number of rewards to apply is based on the reward rate and the amount of time that has passed since the last reward update
544: @> uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
545: @>     REWARD_PERIOD;
546:
547: @> // The rewards per token is the current rewards per token plus the rewards to apply divided by the total staked balance
548: @> return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance;
549: }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider only updating the rewards every x seconds or minutes, and otherwise, just return the current rewards per token. This ensures sufficient time has passed between updates, and the reward calculation is not rounded down to 0.

Additionally, consider performing the multiplication with `10 ** stakedTokenDecimals` before dividing by `REWARD_PERIOD` in lines 544-545 to increase the precision of the result.
