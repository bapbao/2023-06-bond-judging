# Incompatible ERC20 token would cause contract Dos

## Summary

Some Incompatible ERC20 tokens would cause contract dos because such tokens dont has standard ERC20 compliant functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens is incompatible with ERC20(like USDT), those token will cause contract dos.
Function `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` inside `TransferHelper` library, some incompatible tokens `transferFrom` or `transfer` return `void` instead of `bool` , those functions will revert transaction, and cause related contract dos.

There are many code use such two functions in FixedStrikeOptionTeller and OTLM.

Incompatible tokens `approve` function will also cause revert from non-zero to non-zero allowance, and cause contract dos.


## Impact

Incompatible ERC20 tokens will cause contract dos.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `SafeERC20` `safeIncreaseAllowance`, `safeDecreaseAllowance`, `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
