# DOS issue in `OTLM` contract when the `payoutToken` revert on transfer 0 token

## Summary
See the detail 

## Vulnerability Detail
The OTLM._claimEpochRewards() function is tasked with claiming rewards for the sender during a particular epoch_. The calculation of the rewards is performed as follows:
```solidity= 
/// link = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/liquidity-mining/OTLM.sol#L499-L500
uint256 rewards = ((rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) * stakeBalance[msg.sender]) /
    10 ** stakedTokenDecimals;
```
It is evident that when `(rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) * stakeBalance[msg.sender]` is smaller than `10 ** stakedTokenDecimals`, the rewards will be assigned a value of `0`. This situation can potentially create an issue when the `create(optionToken, rewards)` function of the `optionTeller` contract is invoked. In the `optionTeller.create()` function, a certain amount equal to `rewards` of `payoutToken` is required to be transferred from the `OTLM` contract to the `optionTeller` contract.
```solidity=
/// link = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L272-L280
function create(
    FixedStrikeOptionToken optionToken_,
    uint256 amount_ /// [#explain] payoutToken amount
) external override nonReentrant {
    ... 
     
    if (call) {
        // Transfer payout tokens from user
        // Check that amount received is not less than amount expected
        // Handles edge cases like fee-on-transfer tokens (which are not supported)
        uint256 startBalance = payoutToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        payoutToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);
        uint256 endBalance = payoutToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        if (endBalance < startBalance + amount_)
            revert Teller_UnsupportedToken(address(payoutToken));
        
    ...
}
```
If the `payoutToken` used in the contract is an unconventional token that reverts when attempting to transfer 0 tokens (as described in this [source](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers)), calling `OTLM._claimEpochRewards()` can result in a revert, potentially causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) issue for various functions such as `stake`, `unstake`, `claimRewards`, and so on.

## Impact
Denial of service

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the calculated `rewards = 0`, skip the function call `optionTeller.create()`.
