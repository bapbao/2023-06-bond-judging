# Loss of precision in Rewards Calculation

## Summary
The calculation method used is susceptible to precision loss, which can lead to inaccurate reward distributions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the following code snippet:
```solidity
rewards = ((rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) * stakeBalance[msg.sender]) / 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals;
```
This code calculates the rewards for a user based on the difference between `rewardsPerTokenEnd` and `userRewardsClaimed`, multiplied by the user's stake balance. However, by performing the multiplication before the division, there is a risk of precision loss.
## Impact
Precision loss can lead to inaccuracies in reward calculations. It can result in incorrect reward amounts being distributed to users, potentially causing financial discrepancies and unfair reward allocations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform the division operation before the multiplication to reduce the risk of precision loss. Adjust the calculation as follows:
```solidity
rewards = ((rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) / 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) * stakeBalance[msg.sender];

```
