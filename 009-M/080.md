# Users can not access the exercise function when the sequencer is down on Arbitrum

## Summary
During a sequencer downtime on Arbitrum, users are unable to exercise their options due to address aliasing caused by the platform's L1-L2 transaction forcing mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a sequencer downtime on Arbitrum, users are unable to exercise their options due to address aliasing caused by the platform's L1-L2 transaction forcing mechanism.

## Impact

The vulnerability results in users being blocked from exercising their options, which can lead to their options expiring without the ability to exercise them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is recommended to introduce a new parameter, `isL1L2`, to the `exercise()` function. When set to `true`, this parameter will de-alias the `msg.sender` value, allowing users to exercise options by force including transactions from L1 when the sequencer is down.
