# Options can expire while users are unable to exercise them during sequencer failure

## Summary

During a sequencing failure event, users may be unable to include L1-L2 transactions, which can result in options expiring without users being able to exercise them.

## Vulnerability Detail

On the Optimism platform, if the sequencer is down, users have the ability to force transactions through from L1 after a 12-hour period. However, on Arbitrium, users can only have their transactions forced included in the core inbox after a 24-hour period when the sequencer is down.

This delay poses a risk of options expiring while users are unable to include transactions within that timeframe.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that users may be locked out of exercising their options if the sequencer is down during the expiration period. Consequently, users may wrongfully lose their options due to the inability to exercise them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement a grace period when the sequencer is down. This grace period should extend the expiry date of options, providing an additional window of time for users to exercise their options. Specifically, options that would expire within the first 12 hours on Optimism or the first 24 hours on Arbitrium should have their expiry date extended. By implementing this grace period, users will have a fair opportunity to exercise their options even if the sequencer experiences downtime.
