# Users can bypass allowList

## Summary

allowList check the token balance before the user stake,  is presumably used to limit the amount of stakeToken staking, but this limit can be bypassed. 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function isAllowed(address user_, bytes calldata proof_) external view override returns (bool) {
        // External proof data isn't needed for this implementation

        // Get the allowlist token and balance threshold for the sender contract
        TokenCheck memory check = checks[msg.sender];

        // Return whether or not the user passes the balance threshold check
        return check.token.balanceOf(user_) >= uint256(check.threshold);
    }
```

For stakeToken, user only need to leave `threshold - 1` balance and then call stake multiple times to bypass the restriction
For other tokens, user can create multiple account to stake.

## Impact

Users can bypass allowList, which seems not work.

## Recommendation

Consider optimizing allowList, use internal accounting
