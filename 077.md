# Malicious users could empty teller quote/payout tokens by repeatedly reclaim expired option token

## Summary
Malicious receivers could empty teller quote/payout tokens by repeatedly reclaim expired option token.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the option tokens expire, receivers can reclaim funds via reclaim(). However, in reclaim(), expired tokens are not burned after being reclaimed, so receivers can just reclaim funds as many times as they wish, draining tokens in the teller's balance. 
## Impact
Malicious receivers can steal all teller's funds.
