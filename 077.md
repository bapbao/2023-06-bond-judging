# Rounding to nearest day is incorrect

## Summary

The calculation of eligible and expiry dates is incorrect, as they are always rounded down to the previous day at 00:00 instead of being rounded to the nearest 00:00.

## Vulnerability Detail

The eligible and expiry dates are calculated by dividing the original values by 1 day, converting them to a 48-bit unsigned integer, and then multiplying them back by 1 day. This rounding operation effectively rounds down to the previous day.

```solidity
eligible_ = uint48(eligible_ / 1 days) * 1 days;

expiry_ = uint48(expiry_ / 1 days) * 1 days;
```

Comment made in the code:
```solidity
// Eligible and Expiry are rounded to the nearest day at 0000 UTC (in seconds) since

// option tokens are only unique to a day, not a specific timestamp.
```

In the provided code comments, it is mentioned that the intention is to round to the nearest day at 00:00 UTC, since option tokens are unique to a day and not a specific timestamp.

However, due to the way Solidity performs rounding, the result is always rounded down to the previous day.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that users' options expire one day earlier than they should. For example, if a user has an option set to expire on the 4th at 11 PM, it will be truncated to the previous day, the 3rd, at 00:00.

As a result, users may miss the opportunity to exercise their options since they expire too early.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correctly round to the closest 00:00 with the knowledge that the default always rounds down.
