# Inappropriate Use of Total Supply for Token Reclaim

## Summary
It seems that the `reclain()` can be called by everyone. The function reclaims all remaining tokens without considering the possibility that some tokens might still be owned by other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
The reclaim function in the contract uses the total supply of the optionToken (line uint256 amount = optionToken.totalSupply();) to determine the amount of tokens to transfer to the receiver. This may vulnerable because the total supply includes tokens that could be owned by other users, and not just the receiver.

e.g:
Alice and Bob both have tokens. Alice calls the reclaim function after the option expiry. Because the function uses the total supply of tokens, Alice gets all tokens, including those owned by Bob.

Vulnerable code
```solidity
uint256 amount = optionToken.totalSupply();
```

## Impact
This could result in an unfair distribution of tokens when the reclaim function is called, leading to situations where the receiver ends up with more tokens than they are entitled to, including tokens that are actually owned by other users. In other words, a user who is eligible to reclaim tokens might end up receiving all tokens, including those owned by others.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The solution is to change the way the amount of tokens to be reclaimed is determined. Instead of using the total supply of tokens, the contract should use the balance of tokens owned by the receiver.
