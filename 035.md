# FixedStrikeOptionTeller#exercise receives the same token for call/put and send out the same tokeb

## Summary
when exercising a call, the user is suppose to send in quote tokens and receive payout tokens and the reverse for puts
## Vulnerability Detail
in FixedStrikeOptionTeller#exercise the user sends in quote tokens when exercising a call and receives the same quote tokens back just less the fee, the same happens with puts where they send in the payout tokens and receive them back with the fee subtracted. this is however wrong as they are suppose to receive payout tokens when exercising a call and quote tokens when exercising a put.
## Impact
users do not receive the intended tokens when exercising their options
