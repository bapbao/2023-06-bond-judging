# Bypassing Balance Threshold Check in `TokenAllowlist` Contract

## Summary
The `TokenAllowlist` contract, designed to implement an allowlist based on token balances, contains a critical flaw in its registration process. The contract fails to perform the balance check correctly, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the intended threshold verification and gain unauthorized access.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the `register` functions of the `TokenAllowlist` contract. After decoding the registration parameters and obtaining the token contract, the contract attempts to query the balance of the token by calling the `balanceOf` function on the token contract. However, the flaw lies in the way this function is called.
```solidity
// Inside the register functions:
try token.balanceOf(address(this)) returns (uint256) {} catch {
    revert Allowlist_InvalidParams();
}
```
The problem is that the contract calls `balanceOf` using `address(this)` as the argument. This means that the contract queries the balance of the token for its own address, rather than the user's address. Consequently, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by deploying a malicious token contract that manipulates the `balanceOf` function to return a falsified balance value equal to or greater than the required threshold for allowlisting.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is severe. An attacker could bypass the intended balance threshold check and gain unauthorized access to functionalities or actions that rely on the allowlist. This could lead to unauthorized control over critical operations or the manipulation of sensitive data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
modify the `balanceOf` calls within the register functions to use the user's `address (user_)` as the argument instead of `address(this)`.
```solidity
// Inside the register functions:
try token.balanceOf(user_) returns (uint256) {} catch {
    revert Allowlist_InvalidParams();
}

```
