# For OracleStrikeOTLM, newly staked token could not be unstaked and its staked rewards could not be claimed in the new epoch due to invalid strike price

## Summary
For OracleStrikeOTLM, new Epoch cannot be started where call option cannot be deployed due to invalid price (See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond-jingyi2811/issues/3) will make newly staked token in the previous epoch, unable to be unstaked and its staked rewards unable to be claimed in the new epoch.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new user who does not have existing staking stakes, no rewards is claimed (See OTLM.sol#L326).

Then, he attempts to unstake the token (Either execute unstake or unstakeAll function) or claim the rewards directly (Either execute claimRewards or claimNextEpochRewards function) IN THE NEW EPOCH, he will be forced to deploy a call option. 

In a OracleStrikeOTLM,  the deployment is going to be fail when the strike price is invalid and owner is unable to do anything because owner cannot set the valid strike price like in a ManualStrikeOTLM. (See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond-jingyi2811/issues/3). 

Likewise, owner is unable to call ```triggerNextEpoch``` to start a new epoch and deploy the call option for the same invalid strike price set by oracle.

## Impact
If the strike price keeps on rising or keep on declining (Meaning keep on hanging in an invalid stake), the only thing user can do is to call ```emergencyUnstakeAll``` function to unstake his rewards and lose his rewards. [Note: emergencyUnstakeAll will works because it does not forced to create a new epoch] 

Therefore, user will lose his staked rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow token to be unstaked and its rewards to be claimed in the new EPOCH even when the strike price is invalid.
