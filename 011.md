# Potential Loss of Funds Due to underflow in unstake Balance Calculation

## Summary
The contract's Unstake function is vulnerable to underflow, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of user funds. This security concern arises when the amount of staking tokens to be withdrawn exceeds the user's stake balance or when the amount is set to zero. Exploiting this vulnerability can result in negative stake balances and disrupt the contract's intended functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function unstake(uint256 amount_) public {
    uint256 userBalance = stakeBalance[msg.sender];

    // Check if the requested amount is greater than the user's stake balance or is zero
    if (amount_ > userBalance || amount_ == 0) {
        revert("Invalid amount to unstake");
    }

    // Perform the unstake by subtracting the amount from the user's stake balance
@>    stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance - amount_;

    // Update the total staked balance
 @>   totalBalance -= amount_;

    // Transfer the staking tokens back to the user
    require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount_), "Token transfer failed");
}

```
In the above code, the vulnerability lies in the subtraction operation `stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance - amount_;` and `totalBalance -= amount_;`. If the requested `amount_` exceeds the user's `userBalance`, an underflow will occur, resulting in a negative balance. Similarly, if the requested `amount_` is set to zero, an underflow will also occur.
## Impact
The impact of this underflow vulnerability can be severe. It can lead to negative stake balances, allowing users to withdraw more tokens than they actually staked. This can disrupt the fairness of the staking system and potentially result in financial losses for both the staking contract and other legitimate stakers. Furthermore, negative balances may introduce inconsistent accounting and cause unexpected behavior in other parts of the contract that rely on accurate balance tracking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a SafeMath library or the built-in SafeMath functions in Solidity to perform arithmetic operations, which automatically handle overflow and underflow conditions.
```solidity
import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract StakingContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    // ...

    function unstake(uint256 amount_) public {
        uint256 userBalance = stakeBalance[msg.sender];

        // Check if the requested amount is greater than the user's stake balance or is zero
        if (amount_ > userBalance || amount_ == 0) {
            revert("Invalid amount to unstake");
        }

        // Perform the unstake by subtracting the amount from the user's stake balance
        stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance.sub(amount_);

        // Update the total staked balance
        totalBalance = totalBalance.sub(amount_);

        // Transfer the staking tokens back to the user
        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount_), "Token transfer failed");
    }

    // ...
}
