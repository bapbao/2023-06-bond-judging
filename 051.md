# Start new epoch rewards could be front-running by MEV


## Summary

`tryNewEpoch` modifier could be front-running by MEV if there's profits for triggering it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user start a new epoch before a function is executed will be rewarded by teller contract. But such mechanism could be monitored in memory pool and be front-running by MEV if there's profits for triggering it.

## Impact

Normal user will be front-running by MEV when start a new epoch, users will lose their rewards and MEV could gain profits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert the tx if `tryNewEpoch` is called by contract, add `require(msg.sender != tx.origin)` inside `tryNewEpoch` to check caller only be EOA account.
