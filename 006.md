# Always returning zero reward when the reward rate is low

## Summary
 Option Token Liquidity Mining can always return zero reward when the rewardrate is a small number or can be changed at anytime

## Vulnerability Detail
Option Token Liquidity Mining can always return zero reward when the rewardrate is a small number since it could even be zero or can be changed at anytime.
Since there is a REWARD_PERIOD it would be best to have a minimum rewardRate .
```solidity
uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
            REWARD_PERIOD;
``` 
this can make rewardsToApply to be zero especially if the difference between the two timestamp is small and rewardRate is low there by dividing with high REWARD_PERIOD . it can potentially keep rewardsPerTokenStored at zero.

## Impact
User wont be able to earn reward

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/liquidity-mining/OTLM.sol#L539

```solidity
 function currentRewardsPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        // Rewards do not accrue if the total balance is zero
        if (totalBalance == 0) return rewardsPerTokenStored;

        // The number of rewards to apply is based on the reward rate and the amount of time that has passed since the last reward update
        uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
            REWARD_PERIOD;

        // The rewards per token is the current rewards per token plus the rewards to apply divided by the total staked balance
        return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance;
    }
```
