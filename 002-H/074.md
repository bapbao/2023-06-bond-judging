# Blacklist receiver maybe unable to reclaim option token leads to fund token in the contract

## Summary
Blacklist receiver maybe unable to reclaim option token leads to token stuck in the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
Receiver (See FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L198) is set while an option is deployed. If it is not exercised within the eligible time, receiver should be allowed to reclaim it back (See FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L430-L436).  However, if the receiver is blacklisted then the payout or quote token will be stuck in the contract forever.

As payout or quote token can be any ERC20 token, the token could implement blacklist feature (For eg USDC) to enable the token admin to blacklist certain address to perform or receive any transferred token.

## Impact
If the receiver is blacklisted then the token will be stuck in the contract forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow option deployer to change receiver to any address. If the original address is blacklisted, at least reclaimed token can be sent to another new non-blacklisted address.
