# Inadequate Expiration Check in `_claimEpochRewards` Function

## Summary
The `_claimEpochRewards` function in the provided contract has an inadequate expiration check for the option token. The function compares the expiration timestamp of the `optionToken` with the current block's timestamp to determine if the option token has expired. However, the lack of rounding the expiration timestamp to the nearest day creates a potential vulnerability that could allow attackers to bypass the check and claim rewards for an expired option token.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
if (uint256(optionToken.expiry()) < block.timestamp) return 0;
```
This code compares the expiration timestamp of the `optionToken` with the current block's timestamp. If the expiration timestamp is lower than the current block's timestamp, it is assumed that the option token has expired, and the function returns zero rewards.
However, the issue lies in the lack of rounding the expiration timestamp to the nearest day. This omission creates a potential security concern as users can manipulate the block timestamp and create a transaction at a specific timestamp to bypass the expiration check. By doing so, they can claim rewards for an expired option token and potentially exploit the rewards system.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is the potential loss of funds for the protocol or the reward pool. By bypassing the expiration check, users can claim rewards for option tokens that have already expired, leading to an imbalance in the rewards distribution and compromising the integrity of the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to round the expiration timestamp of the optionToken to the nearest day. This rounding ensures a more accurate expiration check and prevents users from manipulating the block timestamp to bypass the expiration check.
