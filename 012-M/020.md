# Last epoch claimed for the user isn't updated on staking, which can permanently stuck the user from claiming rewards.

## Summary
Last epoch claimed for the user isn't updated on staking, which can permanently stuck the user from claiming rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user stakes for the first time, the function stake updated the user's rewards per token claimed to the current rewards per token stored, but forgets to update the user's last epoch claimed to the current epoch.

```solidity
    function stake(
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external nonReentrant requireInitialized updateRewards tryNewEpoch {
        // Revert if deposits are disabled
        if (!depositsEnabled) revert OTLM_DepositsDisabled();

        // If allowlist configured, check if user is allowed to stake
        if (address(allowlist) != address(0)) {
            if (!allowlist.isAllowed(msg.sender, proof_)) revert OTLM_NotAllowed();
        }

        // Revert if deposit amount is zero to avoid zero transfers
        if (amount_ == 0) revert OTLM_InvalidAmount();

        // Get user balance, if non-zero, claim rewards before increasing stake
        uint256 userBalance = stakeBalance[msg.sender];
        if (userBalance > 0) {
            // Claim outstanding rewards, this will update the rewards per token claimed
            _claimRewards();
        } else {
            // Initialize the rewards per token claimed for the user to the stored rewards per token
            rewardsPerTokenClaimed[msg.sender] = rewardsPerTokenStored;
        }

        // Increase the user's stake balance and the total balance
        stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance + amount_;
        totalBalance += amount_;

        // Transfer the staked tokens from the user to this contract
        stakedToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);
    }
```

When claiming rewards for the user, the function will try to go over all of the past epochs to the current one. This all happens in a for loop, which calls the function _claimEpochRewards as much as the number of the past epochs. 

This could possible result to the transaction running out of gas, or needing an enormous amount of gas to proceed all of the calls made to the function _claimRewards so that the user can finally claim his rewards on the current epoch.

When deployed the OTML pool is intended to run forever and stakers are free to stake at any given time, so there could be a lot of passed epochs since the deployment of the pool. Which is problematic for later stakers, as they won't be able to claim their rewards and will simply emergency unstake. 

Note:
The function claimNextEpochRewards() can't be used to help the situation here. As on staking the user's rewardsPerTokenClaimed was updated to the current rewardsPerTokenStored, the function _claimEpochRewards will stop at the if statement (userRewardsClaimed >= rewardsPerTokenEnd) and return 0 before updating the mapping lastEpochClaimed to the next epoch in line. (For more info look at my other finding for claimNextEpochRewards).

```solidity
    function _claimRewards() internal returns (uint256) {
        // Claims all outstanding rewards for the user across epochs
        // If there are unclaimed rewards from epochs where the option token has expired, the rewards are lost

        // Get the last epoch claimed by the user
        uint48 userLastEpoch = lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender];

        // If the last epoch claimed is equal to the current epoch, then only try to claim for the current epoch
        if (userLastEpoch == epoch) return _claimEpochRewards(epoch);

        // If not, then the user has not claimed all rewards
        // Start at the last claimed epoch because they may not have completely claimed that epoch
        uint256 totalRewardsClaimed;
        for (uint48 i = userLastEpoch; i <= epoch; i++) {
            // For each epoch that the user has not claimed rewards for, claim the rewards
            totalRewardsClaimed += _claimEpochRewards(i);
        }

        return totalRewardsClaimed;
    }
```

```solidity
    function _claimEpochRewards(uint48 epoch_) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Claims all outstanding rewards for the user for the specified epoch
        // If the option token for the epoch has expired, the rewards are lost

        // Check that the epoch is valid
        if (epoch_ > epoch) revert OTLM_InvalidEpoch();

        // Get the rewards per token claimed by the user
        uint256 userRewardsClaimed = rewardsPerTokenClaimed[msg.sender];

        // Get the rewards per token at the start of the epoch and the rewards per token at the end of the epoch (start of the next one)
        // If the epoch is the current epoch, the rewards per token at the end of the epoch is the current rewards per token stored
        uint256 rewardsPerTokenStart = epochRewardsPerTokenStart[epoch_];
        uint256 rewardsPerTokenEnd = epoch_ == epoch
            ? rewardsPerTokenStored
            : epochRewardsPerTokenStart[epoch_ + 1];

        // If the user hasn't claimed the rewards up to the start of this epoch, then they have a previous unclaimed epoch
        // External functions protect against this by their ordering, but this makes it explicit
        if (userRewardsClaimed < rewardsPerTokenStart) revert OTLM_PreviousUnclaimedEpoch();

        // If user rewards claimed is greater than or equal to the rewards per token at the end of the epoch, then the user has already claimed all rewards for the epoch
        if (userRewardsClaimed >= rewardsPerTokenEnd) return 0;
```

## Impact
As last epoch claimed isn't updated to the current one on staking, later stakers could experience unable to claim their rewards duo to the function claim rewards running out of gas.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The solution here is simple, update the lastEpochClaimed to the current epoch when the user stakes for the first time.

```solidity
    function stake(
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external nonReentrant requireInitialized updateRewards tryNewEpoch {
        // Revert if deposits are disabled
        if (!depositsEnabled) revert OTLM_DepositsDisabled();

        // If allowlist configured, check if user is allowed to stake
        if (address(allowlist) != address(0)) {
            if (!allowlist.isAllowed(msg.sender, proof_)) revert OTLM_NotAllowed();
        }

        // Revert if deposit amount is zero to avoid zero transfers
        if (amount_ == 0) revert OTLM_InvalidAmount();

        // Get user balance, if non-zero, claim rewards before increasing stake
        uint256 userBalance = stakeBalance[msg.sender];
        if (userBalance > 0) {
            // Claim outstanding rewards, this will update the rewards per token claimed
            _claimRewards();
        } else {
            // Initialize the rewards per token claimed for the user to the stored rewards per token
            rewardsPerTokenClaimed[msg.sender] = rewardsPerTokenStored;
+           lastEpochClaimed[msg.sender] = epoch;
        }

        // Increase the user's stake balance and the total balance
        stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance + amount_;
        totalBalance += amount_;

        // Transfer the staked tokens from the user to this contract
        stakedToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);
    }
```
