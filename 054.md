# Adversary can spam tx to stop accuring the rewards

## Summary
See the detail 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `updateRewards` modifier is employed to update the stored rewards per token. This update occurs immediately before invoking the `stake/unstake/unstakeAll/claimRewards/claimNextEpochRewards` functions. The variable `rewardsPerTokenStored` is updated by assigning it the value returned by the `currentRewardsPerToken()` function.
```solidity=
function currentRewardsPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
    // Rewards do not accrue if the total balance is zero
    if (totalBalance == 0) return rewardsPerTokenStored;

    // The number of rewards to apply is based on the reward rate and the amount of time that has passed since the last reward update
    uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
        REWARD_PERIOD;

    // The rewards per token is the current rewards per token plus the rewards to apply divided by the total staked balance
    return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance;
}
```
It is evident that when `block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate` is sufficiently small, the expression `rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance` can evaluate to 0, resulting in the `rewardsPerTokenStored` remaining unaltered. Consequently, no rewards will be accrued in this situation.

An attacker could exploit this by repeatedly calling the `claimRewards` function every block (or some blocks based on a calculated frequency) to deliberately trigger this scenario and prevent any rewards from being accumulated.

## Impact
Rewards can't be accrued lead to no incentives for the users to use `OTLM` contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A solution to mitigate the issue is caching the remainder of `rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) % totalBalance` to a storage variable `rewardsRemainder` and modify the function `currentRewardsPerToken` as follows: 
```solidity=
/// new storage variable here 
uint256 rewardsRemainder;

function currentRewardsPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (totalBalance == 0) return rewardsPerTokenStored;

    uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
        REWARD_PERIOD;
    
    /// change here 
    uint256 remainder = rewardsRemainder; 
    rewardsRemainder = (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals + remainder) % totalBalance; 
    
    return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals + remainder) / totalBalance;
}
```
