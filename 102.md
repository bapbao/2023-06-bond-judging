# Wrong comparison between block.timestamp , eligible_, and expiry_

## Summary
When deploying a new ERC20 option token using `deploy` function in Teller contract, we check  whether the `eligible_` and `expiry_` are correct according to the invariants.

They are first truncated to 1 days .
```solidity
eligible_ = uint48(eligible_ / 1 days) * 1 days;
        expiry_ = uint48(expiry_ / 1 days) * 1 days;
```

Then compared through `truncated` block.timestamp
```solidity
 if (eligible_ < uint48(block.timestamp / 1 days) * 1 days)
            revert Teller_InvalidParams(2, abi.encodePacked(eligible_));

```

Problem is in other functions like `create` , `exercise` and `reclaim`, we are not comparing this way. 



## Vulnerability Detail

Example: 
A option token is deployed with following params : 
Before truncation
eligible_ = 1688821688
expiry_ = 1689520088  

After truncation , 
eligible_ = 1688774400
expiry_ = 1689465600

Now. we compare eligible_ (truncated) with block.timestamp(truncated)

```solidity
if (eligible_ < uint48(block.timestamp / 1 days) * 1 days)
            revert Teller_InvalidParams(2, abi.encodePacked(eligible_));
```

We don't check expiry , as eligible_ is already checked. As stated in comments 
```solidity
        // Don't need to check expiry against current timestamp since eligible is already checked

```

Bob calls `create` at following state:
Before Truncation
- block.timestamp  - 1689465654

After truncation 
- block.timestamp = 1689465600

Using current calculation 
```solidity
        if (uint256(expiry) < block.timestamp) revert Teller_OptionExpired(expiry);

```
1689465600(truncated expiry) < 1689465654 (normal timestamp)  is **true** , hence call will revert.

But if we compare with truncated timestamp 

1689465600(truncated expiry) < 1689465600 (truncated time) is **false** 


This behaviour is similar in `reclaim` and `exercise`.

## Impact

Even though call is valid, call will revert.

## Recommendation
Either compare using truncated block.timestamp everywhere, or compare to untruncated . Use a consistent policy
