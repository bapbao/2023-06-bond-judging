# Detect collision due to dynamic type usages

## Summary
The collision issues in the `_getNameAndSymbol ` function can lead to unintended conflicts and unexpected behavior in the system. Different combinations of _input parameters_ can generate the same `name` and `symbol ` values, causing _confusion and compromising data integrity_.

## Vulnerability Detail
The detection of a collision due to dynamic type usages in `abi.encodePacked ()` means that there is a risk of unintended collisions occurring in the generated `name` and `symbol` strings. The code uses dynamic inputs, such as `token symbols`, `strike prices`, and _date components_, to construct these strings. However, collisions can occur if different combinations of inputs produce the same resulting `name` or `symbol`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts within the system.

## Impact

Collisions in the generated strings can compromise the integrity of the data stored or processed based on the generated `name` and `symbol`, however, collisions can result in unpredictable behavior. This may affect the functionality, logic, or business processes that rely on the uniqueness of these strings.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As [slither's Detector-Documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#recommendation-3), 
Do not use more than one dynamic type in `abi.encodePacked() `.  Use `abi.encode()`, preferably.
