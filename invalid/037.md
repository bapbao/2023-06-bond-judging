# FixedStrikeOptionTeller create function is vulnerable for attacker to steal contract fund directly


## Summary

When create option tokens, it's vulnerable for attacker to mint option tokens without transfer quote tokens to teller contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `create` function of the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller` contract, when user create option tokens, user need transfer `quoteAmount` quote tokens to teller contract, after that, teller contract will mint `amount_` option tokens to users.

And according to the code `uint256 quoteAmount = amount_.mulDiv(strikePrice, 10 ** payoutToken.decimals());`, quoteAmount would be 0 under some conditions. Since that is the case, the attacker can mint option tokens without transfer quote tokens to teller contract.

Example:

`payoutToken.decimals()` is `18`, `strikePrice` is `1 * 1e6`, `amount_` is `9 * 1e11`,

`quoteAmount = 9 * 1e11 * 1 * 1e6 / 10 ** 18` would be 0, teller contract would mint `9 * 1e11` option tokens to attacker with transfer 0 quote tokens to teller contract. Because such contract will be deployed on Arbitrum and Optimism, the only cost is gas fee and gas fee is very low on L2 networks, attacker could repeat such a process in loop to save gas fee and gain profit by this function.

## Impact

Attacker can gain profits by mint option tokens without transfer quote tokens to teller contract.

## Recommendation

Revert the tx if `quoteAmount` is 0.
