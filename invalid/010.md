# Potential Loss of Funds Due to Overflow in Stake Balance Calculation

## Summary
The `stake` function in the smart contract is susceptible to an overflow vulnerability, which can lead to incorrect stake balance calculations and potential loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the line `stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance + amount_;`, where the `amount_` is added to the current `userBalance` to update the stake balance. If the resulting value exceeds the maximum representable value of `uint256`, an overflow occurs, and the stake balance calculation becomes incorrect.
Let's consider the following scenario:
1. Assume there is a user, Alice, who intends to stake a large amount of tokens, let's say `2^256 - 1` (the maximum value representable by a `uint256` data type).
2. In the `stake` function, the line `stakeBalance[msg.sender] = userBalance + amount_;` is responsible for updating the user's stake balance.
3. Due to the overflow vulnerability, when Alice stakes the maximum amount, the addition operation `userBalance + amount_` will result in an overflow, wrapping the value back to 0. As a result, Alice's stake balance will be incorrectly set to 0 instead of the intended large value.
4. This incorrect stake balance can have severe consequences. It can lead to financial loss for Alice, as she expected to have a significant stake in the contract but ended up with no stake at all.
5. Moreover, this incorrect balance can also affect the overall calculations and distribution of rewards within the contract. It can lead to inaccurate rewards distribution and unfairness among stakers.
## Impact
The overflow vulnerability can result in the loss or manipulation of user funds, causing financial harm to affected users and compromising the fairness and integrity of the contract's reward distribution system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Use SafeMath Library: Incorporate a SafeMath library or leverage the built-in SafeMath functions in Solidity to perform arithmetic operations involving stake balances.
2. Add a check before updating the stake balance to ensure that the addition does not exceed the maximum value of uint256. 
```solidity
require(stakeBalance[msg.sender] + amount_ >= stakeBalance[msg.sender], "Stake: Overflow");
stakeBalance[msg.sender] += amount_;

```
