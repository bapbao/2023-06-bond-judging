# No Balance Check Before Transferring Collateral in the Reclaim Function

## Summary
This issue arises from the fact that when the reclaim function is called, it attempts to transfer a certain amount of either quoteToken or payoutToken from the contract to the receiver without checking if the contract has a sufficient balance of the respective tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the smart contract, the receiver can invoke the reclaim function to claim the remaining collateral once the option is expired. This operation involves a transfer of tokens from the contract to the receiver.

However, the function doesn't perform a check to ensure that the contract has a sufficient balance of quoteToken or payoutToken before attempting the transfer. This can potentially lead to a failed transaction if the contract's balance of the required tokens is less than the amount intended for transfer.

## Impact
If token transfer fail, the entire transaction is rolled back. So, if the contract tries to transfer more tokens than it has, the entire transaction, including any other operations and state changes that might be part of it, will be reverted. This can lead to a situation where users cannot reclaim their tokens due to a shortage of tokens in the contract.

## Recommendation
It is generally considered good practice to check that the contract has enough of a balance to cover the transfer before attempting it.
