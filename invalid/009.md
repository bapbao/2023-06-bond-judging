# Risk of Improper Reward Distribution due to Missing Initialization Check

## Summary
The claimRewards() function in the contract lacks an initialization check, allowing users to claim rewards even when the contract is not properly initialized. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of the `requireInitialized` modifier opens up the possibility of unauthorized reward claims and undermines the intended behavior of the contract. It is crucial to address this vulnerability to ensure that rewards are only distributed when the contract is in a valid and fully initialized state.
## Impact
Without the initialization check, users can exploit the vulnerability to claim rewards before the contract is fully initialized.
This can lead to a situation where rewards are distributed prematurely or inaccurately. The unfair distribution of rewards can result in financial losses for other users who have legitimately staked their tokens and were expecting a fair share of the rewards. Moreover, the contract's intended reward distribution mechanism can be undermined, leading to a loss of trust and credibility in the system.

## Recommendation
Add Initialization Check: Incorporate the `requireInitialized` modifier into the `claimRewards()` function. This ensures that the contract is initialized before allowing users to claim their rewards.
