# Fee Calculation Issue in FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol

## Summary
The vulnerability identified in the exercise fee calculation within the FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol contract can potentially lead to incorrect fee calculations.

However there is only one function `setProtocolFee` in the same contract and this `setProtocolFee` is not called my any other function or contract. Which means that if the user failed/forgot to call the `setProtocolFee` which is setting-up the `protocolFee`, the issue will exists.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs when the `protocolFee` variable is erroneously set to 0 at line [#L95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L95) in the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol` contract. This `protocolFee` value is later used in the fee calculation process within the exercise function. Since any value multiplied or divided by 0 results in 0, the fee calculation becomes inaccurate and potentially leads to incorrect fee assessments.


## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability can lead to incorrect fee calculations within the FixedStrikeOptionTeller contract. It can result in inaccurate fee assessments, potentially affecting the overall financial transactions and profitability for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the vulnerability in the FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol contract related to the incorrect fee calculation, it is recommended to call the setProtocolFee function at the time of creating a new token. This ensures that the protocolFee is set appropriately without any issues.

By invoking the setProtocolFee function during token creation, you can ensure that the protocolFee variable is initialized with the desired value. This will enable accurate fee calculations within the FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol contract, avoiding any miscalculations or potential errors.
