# Fee in contract `FixedStrikeOptionTeller` can be bypassed by the protocol integrate with Bond

## Summary
See the detail 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise()` function is employed to exercise an `optionToken` by supplying the necessary quote tokens. In return, the sender receives a specific quantity of payout tokens. Within this function, the sender incurs a fee, which amounts to `protocolFee / FEE_DECIMALS` of the quote tokens they receive.
```solidity=

uint256 fee = (quoteAmount * protocolFee) / FEE_DECIMALS/*1e5*/;
fees[quoteToken] += fee;
```
However, there is an exception when the sender is the same as the receiver; in this case, the fee will be skipped.

It is important to note that the ownership of the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller` contract lies with Bond. However, the `OTLM` contracts can be generated by a third party for the distribution of their tokens. This third party has the ability to deploy a contract and designate it as the `receiver` for the `OTLM` contracts. By creating this `receiver` contract, the third party establishes a potential loophole for their users to circumvent Bond's protocol fee when exercising the `optionToken`. This can be achieved by incorporating a function within the `receiver` contract to interact with the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise()` function. The process of this function can be described as follows:
* transfer `optionToken` from sender to `receiver` contract. 
* transfer `quoteToken` from sender to `receiver` contract. 
* call `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise()`. 
* transfer `payoutToken` from `receiver` contract to the sender.

## Impact
There won't be any fee accured for the bond protocol

## Recommendation
Consider to charge fee when calling function `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise()` even the sender is the `receiver`.
