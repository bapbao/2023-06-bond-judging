# Event not emitted for core function calls.

## Summary
In the protocol there was no event emitted for core functionalities has been called.
## Vulnerability Detail
In function calls like `deploy()` there was no event emitted after the `fixedStrikeOptionToken` was deployed.  this is also the case with transfers of tokens, setting new duration, setting reward duration, claiming rewards, starting new epoch, staking, unstaking and deployment of the `OTLM`. these core actions should emit events
## Impact
no way of tracking the contracts activities off-chain can affect the user friendliness of the protocol
