# Potentially excessive gas fees imposed on users

## Summary
Potentially excessive gas fees imposed on users 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function stake(
        uint256 amount_,
        bytes calldata proof_
    ) external nonReentrant requireInitialized updateRewards tryNewEpoch {
        //... code omitted for brevity

        uint256 userBalance = stakeBalance[msg.sender];
        if (userBalance > 0) {
            // Claim outstanding rewards, this will update the rewards per token claimed
            _claimRewards();
        } else {
            // Initialize the rewards per token claimed for the user to the stored rewards per token
            rewardsPerTokenClaimed[msg.sender] = rewardsPerTokenStored;
        }

        //... code omitted for brevity
    }
```

In the above code, if the user has a non-zero balance, then they are required to claim all outstanding rewards by invoking _claimRewards() within the stake function.

Each iteration of the loop (each epoch) requires computational power (hence gas) to calculate the rewards and update the state of the contract.

## Impact
As a result, the total gas fees user has to pay for this stake operation can become significantly high. If useris a small staker, these gas fees might even outweigh her rewards, making the staking operation economically unviable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider also allow users to claim their rewards manually using a dedicated claimRewards function
