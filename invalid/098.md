# Incorrect calculation of current rewards per token.

## Summary
when calculating the current rewards per token , rewards per token stored is added to rewards to apply then divided by the total balance. However , this should not be case since rewards per token token stored was already divided by the total balance in the first place and due to this the current rewards per token will  be more than the actual current rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

        // The rewards per token is the current rewards per token plus the rewards to apply divided by the total staked balance
        return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance;
    }

## Impact
Incorrect values of current rewards per token.

return this instead
  rewardsPerTokenStored + ( (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance ) ;
