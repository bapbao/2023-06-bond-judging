# Receiver can still be set to address(0)

## Summary
Receiver can still be set to address(0)
## Vulnerability Detail
In the initialize function of the OTLM contract it states that the  option reciever cannot be address 0 
```solidity
        if (receiver_ == address(0)) revert OTLM_InvalidParams();
``` 
But the setOptionReceiver function can still be used to reset receiver to zero address

## Impact
if owner should mistakenly call setOptionReceiver with zero address , then all funds is lost.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function setOptionReceiver(address receiver_) external onlyOwner requireInitialized {
        // Set the receiver
        receiver = receiver_;
    }
```
