# There is not a long enough grace period between the end of epoch and the expiration of the option tokens of this epoch

## Summary
When calling the functions `setOptionDuration` or ` setEpochDuration `, the contract checks if `timeUntilEligible + eligibleDuration` is longer than `epochDuration` to make sure that all options granted during the epoch can be exercised. But users might not be able to exercise all their options since the difference between the time an epoch ends and the options granted during the epoch expire can be as little as 1 second.  

## Vulnerability Detail

If `timeUntilEligible + eligibleDuration` is 1 second longer than the `epochDuration`, all users that earned option token as a reward have 1 second to claim their option tokens and to exercise them. This will not be possible, especially because normal users will use the UI of the OTLM and will therefore need to make two different transactions, one to claim their rewards and another one to exercise the options.

## Impact

User will lose out on option tokens and their monitory benefits since they will not be able to claim and exercise all the option tokens they earned during a period.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid the scenario described above, there should be a grace period of e.g. one day between the end of the epoch and the expiration of the option tokens of the epoch. 

Change this:

if (timeUntilEligible_ + eligibleDuration_ < epochDuration) revert OTLM_InvalidParams();

To this:

if (timeUntilEligible_ + eligibleDuration_ < epochDuration + 1 days ) revert OTLM_InvalidParams();
