# Frontrunning epochs for rewards

## Summary
It's possible to deposit just before an epoch and withdraw as soon as it starts.
This creates an incentive for a user to claim rewards while not contributing to the protocol.
Basically diminishing the rewards pot.

This is possible because there is no way to penalize or withhold the user from doing this.
Most project include a base fee at every withdrawal or implement a timelock on withrawal
