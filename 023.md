# Any user can drain payoutTokens from OTLM contract via a flashloan

## Summary
By taking a flashloan of stakedToken it is possible to drain payoutTokens out of the `OTLM.sol` contract and receive optionTokens at no cost. This can be done since **reward calculations for a user is performed upon claiming the rewards and relies on user's stakeBalance**.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the `stake()` function is called, before anything else `updateRewards` modifier is called. It updates only the global `rewardsPerTokenStored` if `lastRewardUpdate` is not the current block.timestamp. 
```solidity
    modifier updateRewards() { // @audit modifier does not update user rewards
        // Update the rewards per token and last reward timestamp
        if (lastRewardUpdate != uint48(block.timestamp)) {
            rewardsPerTokenStored = currentRewardsPerToken();
            lastRewardUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);
        }
        _;
    }
```
`rewardsPerTokenStored` is calculated by multiplying the rewardRate with delta between updates and dividing by the reward period, then again dividing by the total supply and adding the previously calculated `rewardsPerTokenStored`:
```solidity
    function currentRewardsPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        // Rewards do not accrue if the total balance is zero
        if (totalBalance == 0) return rewardsPerTokenStored;

        // The number of rewards to apply is based on the reward rate and the amount of time that has passed since the last reward update
        uint256 rewardsToApply = ((block.timestamp - lastRewardUpdate) * rewardRate) /
            REWARD_PERIOD;

        // The rewards per token is the current rewards per token plus the rewards to apply divided by the total staked balance
        return rewardsPerTokenStored + (rewardsToApply * 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals) / totalBalance;
    }
```
The actual rewards earned are calculated upon their claim in internal `_claimEpochRewards` function.
```solidity
// If the option token is still valid, we need to issue rewards
// audit-info rewardsPerTokenEnd == rewardPerTokenStored for current epoch
        uint256 rewards = ((rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) * stakeBalance[msg.sender]) /
            10 ** stakedTokenDecimals; // @audit rewards are calculated upon claim
```
This amount in payoutToken is then transfered to the `optionTeller` contract to mint optionTokens which will be the actuall rewards for user
```solidity
        // Mint the option token on the teller
        // This transfers the reward amount of payout tokens to the option teller in exchange for the amount of option tokens
        payoutToken.approve(address(optionTeller), rewards);
        optionTeller.create(optionToken, rewards);

        // Transfer rewards to sender
        ERC20(address(optionToken)).safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards);
```
**The issue is that the rewards are calculated based on the `stakeBalance[msg.sender]` and transfered right after that.**

The following can happen within one epoch:
1. UserA stakes 100 tokens at time `t1`, the `totalBalance == 100`.
2. UserB takes a flashloan for X amount of stakedTokens at time `t2` and calls the `stake()` function with the amount taken. At this point the `rewardsPerTokenStored` would be calculated for the first stake. Since UserB has no balance, the `stake()` function just updates `totalBalance` and `stakeBalance[UserB]` with X amount
3. In the same transcation at time `t2` UserB calls `claimRewards` function. `updateRewards` modifier does not update `rewardsPerTokenStored` as claim is called the same time UserB stakes.
4. `claimRewards()` proceeds to the internal function `_claimEpochRewards()` where the abovementioned reward calculation is performed.
5. UserB succesfully drained the pool and received optionTokens. Now he can call `emergencyUnstakeAll()` or any other unstake function to repay the flashloan.
## Impact
Loss of funds for owners of `OTLM` contract and free profit for the attacker.
Other users also suffer from this as they will not be able to claim their rewards.

## Recommendation
Create `rewards[epoch][account]` mapping and update it within the `updateRewards` modifier.
