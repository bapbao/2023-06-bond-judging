# Start new epoch rewards could be front-running by MEV

## Summary

`tryNewEpoch` modifier could be front-running by MEV if there are profits for triggering it.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user starts a new epoch before a function is executed and will be rewarded by a teller contract. But such a mechanism could be monitored in the memory pool and be front-running by MEV if there are profits for triggering it.

## Impact

Normal users will be front-running by MEV when start a new epoch, users will lose their rewards and MEV could gain profits.
