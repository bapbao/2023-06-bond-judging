# If msg.sender == receiver, the contract does not require any fee payment.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation of the exercise function, if msg.sender is the receiver, the contract does not require any fee payment. This is because the code block handling fee payment and token transfer is nested inside an if-statement that checks if msg.sender is not the receiver (if (msg.sender != receiver)).

## Impact
Based on the comments and code logic, the contract is designed to deduct a fee from the tokens being transferred during the exercise of the option, with these fees being collected by the protocol. 
If a user is exercising an option and the msg.sender is the same as the receiver (essentially, the user is exercising the option for themselves), the code skips the entire fee deduction and token transfer process due to the conditional statement if (msg.sender != receiver). This creates an inconsistency in the contract, as the intended protocol fees are not being deducted in this scenario.
