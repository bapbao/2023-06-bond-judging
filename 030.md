# Option Tokens can be claimed and created but not exercised at the exact time of expiry

## Summary
In the function ```_claimEpochRewards``` in OTML.sol contract, the check for whether the option token has expired is strictly greater than. This means that at the exact time of expiry the function will still transfer option tokens to the user who claimed the rewards and also create them in line 505. 

However, in line 336 of the function ```exercise``` in FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol the option token is deemed to be expired meaning it cannot be exercised.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ReadMe states that 
>Option tokens which have expired are not claimed in order to save gas. 

There seems to inconsistency with the checks for whether the option token has expired or not. 

## Impact

This can lead to excess gas costs or just general unexpected behaviour within the protocol as users that should be able to exercise their option tokens will not be able to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to mitigate the inconsistency between the checks I would suggest having all the expiry checks be consistent. I.e. strictly ```expiry >`block.timestamp``` or ```expiry >= block.timestamp```.
