# `rewardsPerTokenEnd` might be less than `userRewardsClaimed`

## Summary
In the function _claimEpochRewards, the rewards calculation does not consider the case where rewardsPerTokenEnd might be less than userRewardsClaimed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The _claimEpochRewards function calculates the rewards for the user with this line of code: 
`uint256 rewards = ((rewardsPerTokenEnd - userRewardsClaimed) * stakeBalance[msg.sender]) / 10 ** stakedTokenDecimals;`.

In this equation, rewardsPerTokenEnd is subtracted from userRewardsClaimed. This subtraction can potentially lead to a negative result if userRewardsClaimed is greater than rewardsPerTokenEnd.

## Impact
users could claim an incorrect amount of rewards
