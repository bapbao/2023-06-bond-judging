# In the case of a blacklisted address `exercise` could revert, making it impossible for users exercise and use their `optionToken`

## Summary
If the ERC20 used in the `deploy` function are using a blacklisted system, like USDC or USDT and the receiver address gets blacklisted, the whole `exercise` in the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol` functionality would break making it impossible for the users to exercise and burn their `optionToken`.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anybody can deploy a new ERC20 fixed strike option token, which can then be used by calling the function `create` to mint `optionTokens` by providing the specific assets,  `payoutToken_` or `quoteToken_` and users who have those specific `optionTokens` can call `exercise` to exercise the specific `optionToken`, by providing the require quote tokens and receiving the amount of payout tokens. 

Imagine this simple case:
- Bob creates deploys a new ERC20 fixed strike option with an ERC20 that has a blacklist mechanism, setting the `receiver` as himself, then provides assets and mints the specific `optionTokens`
- Multiple other users do the same thing calling the `create` function providing assets to get the specific `optionToken`, so they can later `exercise`
- Meanwhile Bob address gets blacklisted by the ERC20 provided, because of something malicious he has done
- Anyone that calls the function `exercise` now would not be able to do anything, since the function would revert all the time, so no one that has provided assets and has the specific `optionTokens` , would be able to exercise and get the amount of `payout`/`quote` tokens that they want, making their `optionTokens` useless.
## Impact
This would have a medium impact on the protocol, since the whole `exercise` logic would be broken for that specific `optionToken` created.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the Pull over Push pattern by saving the amount that the `receiver` would get in a storage variable and letting the receiver pull all of his assets later, instead of pushing it in the `exercise` function, so in a case where the `receiver` gets blacklisted ,users would still be able to interact normally with the protocol.
