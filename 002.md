# Trading fees should round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking to traders

## Summary
Trading fees should always round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking from the system to traders.

## Vulnerability Detail
FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise() [L347](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L347) & [L364](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L364) calculate the fee using regular solidity multiplication & division which truncates the result, equivalent to a floor operation or rounding down. This results in the fee being lower than it should be, resulting in value leaking out from the system to traders.

While the value which leaks out from the system to traders on each transaction is small, this amount continually compounds over time as it happens continually. The more the system is used, the greater the cumulative value leak becomes.

## Impact
Value will continuously leak out from the system to traders; the greater the usage of the system & the longer the system runs, the greater the value leak becomes.

## Code Snippet
FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise() [L347](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L347) & [L364](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/fixed-strike/FixedStrikeOptionTeller.sol#L364)

## Tool used
I learned this vulnerability using [Solodit.xyz](https://solodit.xyz/issues/different-rounding-directions-are-recommended-for-getting-buysell-info-cyfrin-sudoswap-markdown_) where it was reported as a Medium vulnerability in one of Cyfrin's audits.

## Recommendation
Trading fees should always round up in favor of the protocol to prevent value constantly leaking from the system to traders. Could use [mulDivUp()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-bond/blob/main/options/src/lib/FullMath.sol#L115) from ``lib/FullMath.sol``.
