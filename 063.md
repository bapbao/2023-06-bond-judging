# If the `receiver` is prevented from receiving exercised proceed tokens, exercising options is not possible

## Summary

The `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise` function transfers the proceeds from exercising options to the `receiver` address. If the `receiver` address is prevented (e.g., blacklisted) from receiving tokens, exercising options is impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail

When exercising options with the `FixedStrikeOptionTeller.exercise` function, the proceeds are transferred to the `receiver` address. For example, if the quote token is USDC, which has the ability to blacklist addresses, and the `receiver` address got blacklisted, the proceeds will not be transferred to the `receiver` address as the token transfer will revert. Consequently, exercising options is not possible.

## Impact

A turned-malicious `receiver` can cause reverting token transfers (e.g., blacklisted USDC address) when transferring the proceeds from exercising options to the `receiver`. This will prevent exercising options.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of sending proceeds from exercising options (quote and payout tokens) directly to the receiver, consider storing the number of tokens in storage and having the receiver claim it at a later time.
