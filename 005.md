# Option Reciever can take out collateral in put options without adding collateral

## Summary
Option Reciever can take out collateral in put options without adding collateral 

## Vulnerability Detail
The optionToken reciever of a put option can basically take out collateral without adding any but this can be seen when the payout and quote token are  small decimals tokens. 
In a scenario where the strikeprice is low E.g

```solidity
   //create functionquoteAmount calc

  // Calculate amount of quote tokens required to mint
  uint256 quoteAmount = amount_.mulDiv(strikePrice, 10 ** payoutToken.decimals());
``` 
 A quotetoken with 6 decimal and a strikePrice of 1e3, calling teller.create with a low amount as 1e2 will make quoteAmount to be paid by the receiver be zero but mints 100 optionToken i.e 1e2 * 1e3  1e6 = 0 . so basically calling the function multiple times will mint more optiontoken that gives the receiver access to the collateral if he calls teller.exercise because he does not pay when calling exercise.
Having minted like 1e6 optionstoken or more  ,  quotetoken collateral output amout  1e6 *1e3 /1e6 .   = 1e3 gain when  no collateral was added

```solidity
       //Exercise function  quoteAmount calc

        // Calculate amount of quote tokens equivalent to amount at strike price
        uint256 quoteAmount = amount_.mulDiv(strikePrice, 10 ** payoutToken.decimals());

``` 

## Impact
Loss of collateral if the reciever is malicious

## Code Snippet
```solidity

            // Calculate amount of quote tokens required to mint
            uint256 quoteAmount = amount_.mulDiv(strikePrice, 10 ** payoutToken.decimals());
```
