# Rewards are incorrectly calculated if a user calls emergencyUnstakeAll() function

## Summary
`emergencyUnstakeAll()` lets a user withdraw his entire staked balance without updating and claiming rewards. This may lead to incorrect accruel of rewards for all users.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the code comments 
```solidity
///      Rewards are continuously accrued based on the configured reward rate and the total
///      balance of staked tokens in the contract. Any user action updates the reward calculations.
```
However, this is not the case when someone calls the emergencyUnstakeAll() function. Since it does not update rewards but decreases `totalBalance`, the `rewardPerTokenStored` might be more than it should, resulting in more rewards distributed to one users at the expense of others.

Consider the following scenario within one epoch (OTLM contract has just been deployed and there are no stakers yet):
1. UserA stakes 100 tokens at time `t1`:
`stakeBalance[UserA] == 100`
`rewardsPerTokenStored == 0`
`totalBalance == 100`
2. UserB stakes 100 tokens at time `t2`, triggering `updateRewards`:
`stakeBalance[UserB] == 100`
`rewardsPerTokenStored == rewardsToApply / totalBalance == rewardsToApply / 100`
`totalBalance == 200`
3. UserA calls `emergencyUnstakeAll()` function at time `t3`:
`stakeBalance[UserA] == 0`
`rewardsPerTokenStored == rewardsToApply / totalBalance == rewardsToApply / 100`
`totalBalance == 100`
4. UserA stakes his 100 tokens at the same time `t3`, triggering `updateRewards`:
 At this point `rewardsPerTokenStored` should be `(rewardsToApply / 100) + (rewardsToApply / 200)`, since totalBalance in time frame `[t2, t3]` was 200 tokens. However, as UserA called `emergencyUnstakeAll()` function, no rewards were updated but `totalBalance` decreased by 100 tokens. Because of it, after UserA staked his 100 tokens again at the same time t3, the `rewardsPerTokenStored == (rewardsToApply / 100) + (rewardsToApply / 100)`. 
## Impact
Incorrect rewards calculation for all users. Since `rewardsPerTokenStored` variable increases amount of rewards for all stakers and since rewards in OTLM are actually optionTokens, less users will receive them if protocol decides to issue fixed amount of optionTokens as rewards.

Another impact is that malicious UserA can repeat this process and earn more rewards than he is entitled to for his staked amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`rewardsPerTokenStored` should be updated upon calling the `emergencyWithdrawAll` function since it updates the total staked balance. Append `updateRewards` modifier to it.
